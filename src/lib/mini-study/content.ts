You decided to visit your professor during office hours to ask for an explanation. When you arrive, you knock on the office door and your professor invites you in. You sit down and get ready to ask your question.",

You are meeting your classmate, Jordan, at the university library today to figure out how to divide the work fairly. You arrive first and find a quiet table.

You have made an appointment with your academic advisor, Ms. Chen, to get some guidance. You walk into her office, and she greets you warmly and asks how she can help you today.",

You decide to call your lab partner, Marcus, to find out what you need to bring and what the experiment involves. You pick up your phone and dial his number.",
